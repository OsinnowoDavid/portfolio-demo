    </h1>
    <p>After graduating from secondary school due to the passion I have for music I applied to halleluiah music of music at Eleshin Lagos state,
       where I learnt how to play saxophone to advance level. 
      I play different genres of music, jazz, classical, gospel, pop and so on. I love doing music, it makes me connect to God through worship in church and also makes me feel fulfilled.
        I take different gigs for wedding, church annuniversery, birthday surprice, proposal and many more. You can contact for more info
